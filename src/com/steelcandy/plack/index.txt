Subdirectories
==============

common
    - contains source files for classes that are useful in the implementations
      of most if not all languages
shared
    - contains source files for classes that are (or at least may be) useful
      in the implementations of more than one language, but aren't likely to
      be useful in the implementations of most/all languages
testing
    - contains source files that define classes for use in testing the
      implementations of languages

Each of the remaining subdirectories contain the source files for classes
that are specific to a single language's implementation.
