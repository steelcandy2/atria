<body>

This package contains classes that represent objects having to do with
pieces of source code. Most of the classes fall into one of the following
groups:
<ul>
    <li><a href="SourceCode.html">SourceCode</a> and its subclasses, which
        represent pieces of source code:
        <a href="SourceCodeFile.html">SourceCodeFile</a> represents a
        piece of source code in a file, and
        <a href="SourceCodeString.html">SourceCodeString</a> represents a
        piece of source code in a Java String
    <li><a href="SourcePosition.html">SourcePosition</a> and
        <a href="SourceLocation.html">SourceLocation</a>, which represent
        the position of a single character and the location of a range of
        characters in a piece of source code, respectively; and
        <a href="SourceLocationFactory.html">SourceLocationFactory</a>
        and its subclasses, which create various types of SourceLocations
    <li><a href="CharacterIterator.html">CharacterIterator</a> and its
        subclasses, which represent iterators over characters
</ul>

In addition, the <a href="HasSourceLocation.html">HasSourceLocation</a>
interface is implemented by classes that represent objects that have a
location in a piece of source code, such as tokens and constructs for
example.
