<body>

This package contains classes that are used in error handling in most or all
language implementations. Most of the classes are either
<ul>
    <li>subclasses of <a href="PlackError.html">PlackError</a> and represent
        an error that was discovered while processing a language's source code,
        or
    <li>subclasses of <a href="ErrorHandler.html">ErrorHandler</a> and represent
        classes that handle the errors that occur while processing a language's
        source code.
</ul>

There are a few notable exceptions:
<ul>
    <li><a href="ErrorSeverityLevels.html">ErrorSeverityLevels</a> is an interface
        that defines constants that represent the various severity levels that an
        error can have
    <li><a href="FatalErrorException.html">FatalErrorException</a> is the class of
        (runtime) exception used to stop processing immediately when a fatal error
        is discovered while processing a language's source code
</ul>
