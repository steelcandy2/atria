<body>

This package contains classes that represent objects having to do with
breaking source code up into tokens. Most of the classes fall into one
of the following groups:
<ul>
    <li><a href="Token.html">Token</a> and its subclasses, which represent
        individual tokens
    <li><a href="Tokenizer.html">Tokenizer</a> and its subclasses, which
        represent convert their input into Tokens:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="SourceCodeTokenizer.html">SourceCodeTokenizer</a>
                and its subclasses convert a piece of source code into
                Tokens
            <li><a href="FilterTokenizer.html">FilterTokenizer</a> and its
                subclasses convert the output of another Tokenizer into
                (usually different) Tokens
        </ul>
    <li><a href="TokenCreator.html">TokenCreator</a> and its subclasses,
        which create zero or more tokens from source code
    <li><a href="TokenCreatorResult.html">TokenCreatorResult</a> and its
        subclasses, which represent the results of TokenCreators creating
        tokens
</ul>

In addition, <a href="TokenFactory.html">TokenFactory</a> can create (vie
reflection) various types of Tokenizers, and
<a href="TokenSink.html">TokenSinks</a> will extract all of the tokens
from a Tokenizer (which is mainly useful in testing Tokenizers).
<p>
Various token-related collection, iterator and predicate classes are also
defined in this package.
